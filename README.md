# Personalised case lids for micro:bit

## Introduction
This documentation describes the design of personalized case lids for the micro:bit microcontroller. The project focuses on creating case lids that allow users to personalize and allow users to customize the appearance of their micro:bit.

## Project description

### Function of the cases
**Robust protection:** The case lids are designed to provide robust protection for the micro:bit microcontroller. The case lids are used to ensure hygiene, safety, freshness or protection from unwanted external influences.

**Distinction:** Another function of case lids as a distinction is to provide a visual indication. Lids can be made of different colours, shapes or patterns to distinguish them from other lids or to identify a certain type of content. In this way, they help consumers or users to quickly identify the correct product.

## Usage
### Connecting the case to the micro:bit
To connect the case lid to the micro:bit microcontroller, simply place the case lid on top of the [micro:bit battery case](battery_case/) so that the case lid connects to the battery case.

## 3D Print
**1. Download files (STL):** You can find them [here](print_STL/).

**2. Insertion into the slicer:** Set the color layer distribution, it is recommended to use two contrasting colors per case lid. Set the print fill rate to 20%. 

**3. Printing:** Printing one case lid should take approximately 30-45 minutes if set up correctly.

## Used references
The [BLOXAT font](font/) was used in this project.

The battery case used in this project is a modified version of the [UOB battery case](battery_case/).

[SOLIDWORKS software](https://www.solidworks.com/) was used to design the case lids.

## Conclusion

Personalized case lids for the micro:bit microcontroller provide users with the ability to customize and extend the functionality of their micro:bit. The project is based on easy to connect caps and allows users to create and experiment with the micro:bit microcontroller.
